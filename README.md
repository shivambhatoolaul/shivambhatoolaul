# 👋 Hi, my name's Shivam!
- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently a Software Developer & DevOps Engineer working with Salesforce at a bank in Canada. 
- 🏫 I studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto and graduated in 2023!
- 🤸 I love calisthenics! My favourite move is the Deep Handstand Pushup, and I am currently working towards an 8s Full Planche.
- 🤖 I'm currently studying Data and AI Engineering in my free time. Am I actually interested in it, or do I just worry about my job prospects everytime I use Copilot? Not sure yet. But, it's been fulfilling so far...
