# 👋 Hi, my name's Shivam!

- 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently a Software Developer & DevOps Engineer working with Salesforce at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC).

- 🏫 I studied Computer Science at the University of Toronto and graduated in 2023!

- 🎥 I've been into video editing since I was 12.

- 💪 I love calisthenics! I have most notably unlocked moves like the Handstand Pushup, Human Flag, Front Lever, One-Arm Pullup, and Planche. I am currently working towards the Planche Press and Pushup.

- ⛳ I started golfing this past year. Few holes, I par. Some holes, quintuple bogey. I am trying to break 100 by the end of summer.
  
- 🤖 I'm currently studying Data and AI Engineering in my free time. Am I actually interested in it, or do I just worry about my job prospects everytime I use Copilot? Not sure yet. But, it's been fulfilling so far...
